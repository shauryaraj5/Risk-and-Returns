# Risk-and-Returns
Calculate and compare profitability and risk of different investments using Sharpe Ratio with Python and its libraries.

When we assess whether to invest in an asset, we want to look not only at how much money we could make but also at how much risk we are taking. The Sharpe Ratio compares the return of an investment to that of an alternative and relates the relative return to the risk of the investment, measured by the standard deviation of returns.
